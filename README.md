# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a **Linear Regression** model. The dataset is synthetically generated to simulate realistic housing data. Features like house size, number of bedrooms, age, distance from the city center, and location rating are analyzed in this repository.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
The goal is to **predict house prices** based on various features that typically influence real estate values.

### Features:
- **Size_sqft:** Size of the house in square feet.
- **Bedrooms:** Number of bedrooms.
- **Age:** Age of the house in years.
- **Distance_miles:** Distance from the city center.
- **Location_rating:** Rating of the location (scale 1-10).

### Target:
- **Price:** Predicted price of the house.
