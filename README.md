# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a **Linear Regression** model. The dataset is synthetically generated to simulate realistic housing data. Features like house size, number of bedrooms, age, distance from the city center, and location rating are considered.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
The goal is to **predict house prices** based on various features that typically influence real estate values.

### Features:
- **Size_sqft:** Size of the house in square feet.
- **Bedrooms:** Number of bedrooms.
- **Age:** Age of the house in years.
- **Distance_miles:** Distance from the city center.
- **Location_rating:** Rating of the location (scale 1-10).

### Target:
- **Price:** Predicted price of the house.
